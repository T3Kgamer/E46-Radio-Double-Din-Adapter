# E46-Radio-Double-Din-Adapter
I'm really (and I mean really) upset that there is only one free option and no offense to the original creator but it's kinda garbage, it works sure but not as elegant as the paid solution. My aim is to make from scratch my own radio adapter using the same method I want to make some adaptations anyways.

All my prototyping files will go here I'm making this from scratch. This repository is to document my progress and ensure this stays open source you can always download it here no matter if it was taken down on any other website containing the STL.

OPEN SOURCE FTW!
